# Uncommon Expo CLI Build and Start Errors

This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for uncommon errors encountered when using the Expo CLI to build or start React Native projects. These errors often stem from issues with project configuration, dependencies, or the Expo Go app itself.  The examples focus on scenarios where standard troubleshooting methods may not provide immediate solutions.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `expoBug.js` file contains code that intentionally triggers an error, simulating a real-world situation.  Instructions on how to reproduce the error will be specified within the `expoBug.js` file.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, along with explanations of the changes made and the reasoning behind those changes. It also includes improved practices and steps that help prevent such issues in the future.
