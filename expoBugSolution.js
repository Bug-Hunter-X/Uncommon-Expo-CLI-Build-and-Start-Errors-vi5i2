The solution will vary depending on the specific error. However, common approaches include:

1. **Verify dependencies:** Ensure that all project dependencies are correctly specified and compatible with your Expo SDK version. Check `package.json` for any conflicting versions or missing packages. Use `expo install` to add or update packages.
2. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes a simple clean and rebuild can resolve temporary issues. Try `expo prebuild` followed by `expo start` or `expo build:ios` / `expo build:android`.
3. **Check Expo Go:** If the error occurs during testing on a device using Expo Go, make sure it is updated to the latest version or try clearing the cache. On Android, this often involves clearing the application's data.
4. **Examine build logs:** The detailed logs produced by Expo during build processes (e.g., from `eas build`) can provide crucial information to identify the root cause.   Examine them carefully, looking for warnings and errors.
5. **Review Expo documentation:** Check the Expo documentation for troubleshooting guidance on specific errors you encounter.
6. **Verify native modules:** If using native modules, ensure they are properly integrated into your project and configured according to the relevant instructions.
7. **Check for conflicts:** Look for conflicts between different dependencies or versions. Try using tools such as `npm-check-updates` to check and update the packages.
