This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI to build or start a React Native project.  The underlying cause often involves issues with the project's configuration, dependencies, or the Expo Go app itself.  For instance, problems with the `eas build` process could lead to missing or conflicting native modules. Additionally, inconsistencies in project setup such as incorrect version specifications for dependencies could result in the error during the build or start process.  Sometimes, it's an issue with the Expo client on the device, like a corrupted cache.
